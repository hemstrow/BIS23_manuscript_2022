abstract = {Summary: The multiplex capability and high yield of current day DNA-sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome sequencing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of reads into contigs has been well addressed. The final step of annotating all relevant genomic features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using existing web- and email-based systems, but these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into computational pipelines. Here we introduce Prokka, a command line software tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial genome in about 10 min on a typical desktop computer. It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing in genome browsers. Availability and implementation: Prokka is implemented in Perl and is freely available under an open source GPLv2 license from http://vicbioinformatics.com/ . Contact:torsten.seemann@monash.edu},

@article{Bankevich2012,
abstract = {Abstract The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V?SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software.},

@article{Bolger2014,
abstract = {Motivation: Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. Results: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. Availability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3.

@article{Altschul1990a,
abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

@article{Becker2014,
abstract = {Organisms across the tree of life use a variety of mechanisms to respond to stress-inducing fluctuations in osmotic conditions. Cellular response mechanisms and phenotypes associated with osmoadaptation also play important roles in bacterial virulence, human health, agricultural production and many other biological systems. To improve understanding of osmoadaptive strategies, we have generated 59 high-quality draft genomes for the haloarchaea (a euryarchaeal clade whose members thrive in hypersaline environments and routinely experience drastic changes in environmental salinity) and analyzed these new genomes in combination with those from 21 previously sequenced haloarchaeal isolates. We propose a generalized model for haloarchaeal management of cytoplasmic osmolarity in response to osmotic shifts, where potassium accumulation and sodium expulsion during osmotic upshock are accomplished via secondary transport using the proton gradient as an energy source, and potassium loss during downshock is via a combination of secondary transport and non-specific ion loss through mechanosensitive channels. We also propose new mechanisms for magnesium and chloride accumulation. We describe the expansion and differentiation of haloarchaeal general transcription factor families, including two novel expansions of the TATA-binding protein family, and discuss their potential for enabling rapid adaptation to environmental fluxes. We challenge a recent high-profile proposal regarding the evolutionary origins of the haloarchaea by showing that inclusion of additional genomes significantly reduces support for a proposed large-scale horizontal gene transfer into the ancestral haloarchaeon from the bacterial domain. The combination of broad (17 genera) and deep (â‰¥5 species in four genera) sampling of a phenotypically unified clade has enabled us to uncover both highly conserved and specialized features of osmoadaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of such datasets, for metagenomics, improvements to automated gene annotation and investigations of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Industrial biotechnology aims to compete as a stronger alternative ensuring environmental friendly microbial-based production that seeks to curb the predicament of pollution. However, the high cost of bioprocessing is a severe drawback, and therefore, new approaches must be developed to overcome this challenge. Halophiles have shown potentials of overcoming this challenge and are of much preference for unsterile and continuous contamination-free bioprocess due to their unique ability to grow under harsh environmental conditions. Recent advances in genetic manipulations have been established to better the performance of halophiles for industrial applications. Many researchers produced various products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), ectoines, biosurfactants, and antioxidants using halophiles, and further efforts have been established to develop halophiles as the foundation for low-cost bioprocess. This paper provides a useful reference for researchers on the merits, drawbacks, achievements, and application of halophiles for bioproduction.},

@article{Lee2017,
abstract = {Thanks to the recent advancement of DNA sequencing technology, the cost and time of prokaryotic genome sequencing have been dramatically decreased. It has repeatedly been reported that genome sequencing using high-throughput next-generation sequencing is prone to contaminations due to its high depth of sequencing coverage. Although a few bioinformatics tools are available to detect potential contaminations, these have inherited limitations as they only use protein-coding genes. Here we introduce a new algorithm, called ContEst16S, to detect potential contaminations using 16S rRNA genes from genome assemblies. We screened 69 745 prokaryotic genomes from the NCBI Assembly Database using ContEst16S and found that 594 were contaminated by bacteria, human and plants. Of the predicted contaminated genomes, 8 % were not predicted by the existing protein-coding gene-based tool, implying that both methods can be complementary in the detection of contaminations. A web-based service of the algorithm is available at www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/contest16s.},
