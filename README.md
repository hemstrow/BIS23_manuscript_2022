# BIS23_manuscript_2022

Files for the manuscript produced by the students, instructors, and TAs of BIS23 A/B during the 2021/2022 academic year. Fasta and annotation files for each of the three main samples and the three contaminated samples are available from GenBank under accession X.

The file "manuscript_prep.rmd" will produce the .docx formatted paper complete with references and table. Note that some small formatting changes using a word processor may be needed to fix indents and other issues that are difficult to fix in the raw .rmd file.
